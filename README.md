# Benchmarks of the ∆∆G calculations in Venus

[Venus](https://venus.sgc.ox.ac.uk/) does not do a full minimisation but cheats by only minimising the neighbourhood 
before and after introducing the variant.
Therefore, it is important to assess the accuracy of Venus ddG calculations.

* For experimental details see [details](details.md)
* For the refactored code for scoring see [scoring notes](scoring.md)
* For the refactored code for analysis see [analyses notes](analyses.md)
* For the dataset of results see XXX.

For previous iterations and other files, see:

* For the code used for the O2567 dataset see [scoring](notes/O2567_scoring.md).
* For the code used for the ProTherm-star dataset see [scoring](notes/ProTherm-star_scoring.md).
* For past summary see [preliminary results](notes/preliminary_results.md)
* Other files within [notes folder](notes).

Do note that the code presented in the markdown was originally on Jupyter notebooks.
So there may be leftover lines that should not worry the reader (see [note on extra fluff](notes/extra_fluff.md))
